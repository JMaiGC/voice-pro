## 📀 Installation

Voice-Pro can be easily installed with one click. Just run 🚀**configure.bat** and 🚀**start.bat**


### step 1. Package preparation
  + Clone or download the latest release (**Source code (zip)**) from  [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/abus-aikorea/voice-pro)](https://github.com/abus-aikorea/voice-pro/)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abus-aikorea/voice-pro.git
```
  

### step 2. Install and run the program
1. 🚀 Run `configure.bat`
   - Install git, ffmpeg and CUDA (if using NVIDIA GPU) on Windows. 
   - You only need to run it the first time.
   - An internet connection is required, and it may take over an hour depending on the system.
   - Never close the Windows-Command window during installation.
2. 🚀 Run `start.bat`
   - Start Voice-Pro. Web-UI will run automatically. 
   - When running for the first time, Voice-Pro is installed first. 
   - An internet connection is required, and it may take over an hour depending on the system. 
   - Never close the Windows-Command window during installation.
   - If a problem occurs during installation, delete the **installer_files** folder and run start.bat again.

### step 3. Uninstall program
* Run `uninstall.bat`:
  - Remove the **installer_files** folder.
  - Remove ffmepg, git and CUDA packages installed on Windows (if selected)
* Voice-Pro has **portable** installation as standard. To uninstall the program, deleting the installation folder is sufficient.


## ❓Tips & Tricks

#### If Browser does not run automatically
- Close the Windows-Commnad window and run start.bat again.
- Run the browser directly and enter the address displayed in the Windows-Command window (e.g. **http://127.0.0.1:7892**) in the address bar.

#### If a CUDA Out-Of-Memory error occurs
- Check the GPU memory status in Windows Task Manager - Performance tab. 
- Set the Denoise level to 0 or 1. Denoise level 2 requires at least 8GB of GPU memory.
- Set Compute Type to int type. The float type has better quality, but requires more GPU memory.

#### How to improve the quality of subtitles?
- The quality of subtitles tends to improve with larger Whisper models, but this is not necessarily the case. large > medium > small > base > tiny 
- Among compute types, float type has good performance. The int type is a model that reduces GPU usage and increases speed through model quantization. On the other hand, performance decreases. 
- If you increase the denoise level, more background sounds will be removed, and only the remaining voice will be used for voice recognition. It does not always guarantee good results.
  

## 📢 caution

Windows Defender may give a warning about untrusted application and disallow further execution of Voice-Pro.
If SmartScreen security level is set to "Warn", just click "More info" and then click "Run anyway". 
If SmartScreen is set to level "Block" there will be no button to run the installation. In this case, open the properties of the start.bat file, and check "Unblock", apply the change and run the start.bat again.

When Windows Defender mistakenly recognizes a batch file as a Trojan, this is often called a 'False Positive'. To solve this problem, you can go through the following steps:

1. File exception handling: In Windows Defender, you can set certain files or processes to skip security scanning. To do this, follow the steps below:
   * Click the ‘Start’ button and go to ‘Settings’.
   * Click ‘Update & Security’.
   * Select ‘Windows Security’ and go to ‘Virus & threat protection’.
   * Click ‘Manage Virus & Threat Protection Settings’.
   * Select 'Add exception' in 'Virus & threat protection settings'.
   * Select 'File or Folder', find the batch file in question and add it as an exception.
2. Temporarily disable Windows Defender: This may be a temporary solution. However, you must be careful when using this method as it may expose your computer to other threats.
3. Report the problem to anti-virus software: If you are sure that the file is not a Trojan horse, you can report it to Microsoft as a False Positive. Microsoft will review this and take any necessary action.
